# DeepSpeech WebSocket Server

This is a [WebSocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket) server (& client) for Mozilla's [DeepSpeech](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech), to allow easy real-time speech recognition, using a separate client & server that can be run in different environments, either locally or remotely.

Work in progress. Developed to quickly test new DeepSpeech models running DeepSpeech in [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) using microphone input from host Windows.

## Features

* Server
    - Streams raw audio data from client via WebSocket
    - Streaming inference via DeepSpeech v0.2+
    - Single-user (issues with concurrent streams)
* Client
    - Streams raw audio data from microphone to server via WebSocket
    - Voice activity detection (VAD) to ignore noise and segment microphone input into separate utterances

## Installation

This package is developed in Python 3.
Activate a virtualenv, then install the requirements for the server and/or client, depending on usage:

```
pip install -r requirements-server.txt
### AND/OR ###
pip install -r requirements-client.txt
```

To run the server in an environment, you also need to install DeepSpeech, which requires choosing either the CPU xor GPU version:

```
pip install deepspeech
### XOR ###
pip install deepspeech-gpu
```

## Server
